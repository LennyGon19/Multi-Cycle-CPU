Multi-Cycle CPU

This project was an extension of the Single-Cycle CPU. This CPU has a better design that does not constrain it to executing each instruction in a single clock cycle. The Multi-Cycle CPU has a control unit which allows a user to manipulate signals in such a way that allows one to re-use entities on different clock cycles.
This project was implemented on Altera 13.OS software and exectued on a Altera DE-2 board.
